That’s awesome 🚀 — you want to do a 30-day coding challenge (“Dig Deeper Desire” in your words 💡). Let’s structure it in a way that builds consistency and gradually improves your problem-solving skills.
✅ Tips from my point of view (“wise points”):

1 problem daily minimum → don’t break the chain.

Focus on patterns, not just answers.

Maintain a notes/journal → write down approaches.

End each week with revision day.

Don’t jump to hard problems too early — grow step by step.
